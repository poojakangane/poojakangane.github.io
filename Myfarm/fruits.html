            <p>1. Strawberries<br>

Strawberries are a juicy, red fruit with a high water content. The seeds provide plenty of dietary fiber per serving. Strawberries contain many healthful vitamins and minerals.

Of particular note, they contain anthocyanins, which are flavonoids that can help boost heart health. The fiber and potassium in strawberries can also support a healthy heart.

In one study, women who ate 3 or more servings per week of strawberries and blueberries — which are both known for their high anthocyanin content — had a lower risk of having a heart attack than those with lower intake.

Strawberries and other colorful berries also contain a flavonoid called quercetin. This is a natural anti-inflammatory compound.

A serving of 3 large strawberries provides the following nutrients:

    17 calories
    4.15 g carbohydrate
    1.1 g of fiber
    9 mg of calcium
    7 mg of magnesium
    83 mg of potassium
    31.8 mg of vitamin C

Strawberries also contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and vitamins B-6, A and K.

The human body cannot make vitamin C itself, so people need to get this vitamin from their diet.Oranges also contain high levels of pectin, which is a fiber that can keep the colon healthy by binding to chemicals that can cause cancer and removing them from the colon.

Oranges also provide the following healthful vitamins:

    vitamin A, a compound that is important for healthy skin and eyesight
    B-vitamins, including thiamin and folate, which help keep the nervous and reproductive systems healthy and help create red blood cells.
